Repository with my own java OO implementation of tic-tac-toe game for 3x3 board with simple console UI.
Tested with testNG (using DataProviders/groups/dependsOnGroups)


Questions about tests addressed:
1) to test smaller pieces of code in Arbiter class, I had to make private methods package-private - common approach
2) Testing simple class with no logic - only hashCode/equals - no need if generated by IDE (do not test java)
4) Data providers - all in one class, as different test modules are using them - good approach (consider Factory)
